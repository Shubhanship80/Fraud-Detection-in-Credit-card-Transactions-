**Business Problem and Importance**
Credit card fraud has become a major worry for financial organizations and cardholders in today's digital age. Because fraudulent operations are becoming more sophisticated, robust fraud detection systems are required. Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions is critical to preventing customers from being charged for illegitimate purchases. It protects both cardholders' financial well-being and financial institutions' trust.

**Objective:**
The project is focused on the creation of a fraud detection system where my major goal is to correctly classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or valid, hence reducing financial losses and increasing security
Business Advantage: 
By attaining this goal, we hope to equip any company with a powerful weapon for mitigating financial losses caused by fraudulent actions. Furthermore, by providing a safe and dependable credit card service, we will increase client confidence and loyalty.

** Implications: **
 The effective implementation of this project has far-reaching consequences, including lower financial risks, compliance with industry standards, and improved reputation. It will enable any company to prevent credit card theft more effectively and build trust in our services.

** Data Overview**
 
 1. Credit card transactions performed by European cardholders in September 2013 are included in the dataset.
 2. Transactions totaled 284,807 entries over a two-day period, out of which 492(0.172%) are fraud.
The dataset has been anonymized and does not contain any specific background information, making it appropriate for secrecy.


**Input Variables:** The dataset includes features generated from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation, labeled 'V1' through 'V28.'Other non-transformed elements include 'Time' (the number of seconds from the initial transaction) and 'value' (the transaction value).
**Output Variables:** The primary output variable is 'Class,' a binary variable that shows whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

After performing Regression, K mean Clustering and Random Forest, based on the metrics such as Recall, F1-Score and accuracy I dentified Random Forest as the model to identify fraud transactionsBecause it can identify complicated patterns in data and is resistant to overfitting, random forest classification is an excellent machine learning technique for fraud detection. According to the findings, random forest classification model has a high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, indicating that it is effective at detecting fraudulent transactions.
